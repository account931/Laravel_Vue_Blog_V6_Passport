## This project is so much like {CLEANSED_GIT_HUB/Laravel_Vue_Blog}, but the main differences:
- <p> This project uses Laravel version 6, while {CLEANSED_GIT_HUB/Laravel_Vue_Blog} uses version 5.4. </p>
- <p> This project uses api auth via Passport, while {CLEANSED_GIT_HUB/Laravel_Vue_Blog} uses api auth via token sent in headers in ajax (in vue). Token is a column {api_token} in DB {Users}  </p>
- <p> As long as this project is on Laravel version 6, it can not use Entrust Rbac like {CLEANSED_GIT_HUB/Laravel_Vue_Blog} do, so it uses Spatie Laravel permission RBAC </p>


## Main features  (same for both projects):
- <p> Api routes use 'middleware' => ['auth:api', 'myJsonForce'] </p>
- <p> Users can view posts and load new, Admin can view, edit and delete </p>
- <p> Users's ability to view posts is implemented in JS in              => /resources/assets/js/WpBlog_Vue/components/pages/blog_2021.vue   </p>
- <p> Users's ability to load new posts is implemented in JS in          => /resources/assets/js/WpBlog_Vue/components/pages/loadnew.vue     </p>
- <p> Admin's ability to view posts with Edit/Delete option is implemented in JS in   =>  /resources/assets/js/WpBlog_Admin_Part/components/pages/list_all.vue</p>
- <p> Admin's ability to edit posts is implemented in JS in                           => /resources/assets/js/WpBlog_Admin_Part/components/pages/editItem.vue</p>
- <p> Admin's ability to delete posts is implemented in JS in                         =>  /resources/assets/js/WpBlog_Admin_Part/components/pages/list_all.vue</p>
- <p> Back-end is implemented in  =>  /Controllers/WpBlog_Rest_API_Contoller.php and  /Controllers/WpBlog_Admin_Part/WpBlog_Admin_Rest_API_Contoller.php</p>

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.
